## <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px"> Hi! Welcome to my profile

I'm 28 years old, I work as a Full Developer at Develcode with Leroy Merlin as my main client. I'm focused on studying the most current languages for web development with the aim of becoming a full-stack with a specialty in the front-end.

<summary>More about me</summary>

I have experience in the industrial market as a machine operator, being responsible for programming the cutting of parts at the beginning of the production line of almost 100 people.

I also worked with automation, having already developed a patented and automated product, a process for making industrial sewing machines, triggering cuts to separate parts in 0.7 milliseconds with embedded programming in C and C ++, boosting production and avoiding waste of materials.
